She is viewed as a witness to the events of 1916 and, in the 100 years since, she has seen the nation blossom before her based on the ideals set out in the Proclamation. She continues to look forward and is a symbol of the past, present and future of the country. At the top of the inner circle, the inscription ‘HIBERNIA’ appears in hand‑rendered lettering that takes influence from the historic Book of Kells. The sunrays reflect well the underlying concept of the Rising and the Proclamation, e.g. the dawning of the new nation/republic. The image of the statue is flanked by the years ‘1916’ and ‘2016’.
