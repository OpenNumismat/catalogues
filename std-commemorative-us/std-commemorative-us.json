  "subject": "Hawaii State Quarters were released on November 3, 2008 as the fiftieth and final coin in the State Quarter series. Hawaii’s original Statehood date was August 21, 1959.\n\nThe reverse design features a statue of Kamehameha I. The inscriptions include the State name, Statehood date, mintage date, “E Pluribus Unum,” and “UA MAU KE EA O KA ‘AINA I KA PONO.” (Translated: The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness.) The coin’s reverse was designed and engraved by Don Everhart.\n\nKing Kamehameha I unified the governance of the Hawaiian Islands in the early 1800′s. He navigated through modern changes while maintaining the native practices and traditional ways of island life. The reverse design depicts the ruler with an outstretched hand towards the eight main Hawaiian Islands.\n\nThe Hawaii Commemorative Quarter Advisory Commission was composed of 36 leaders and students from around the state. They solicited design themes from the state’s citizens and forwarded five to the United States Mint for artistic renderings. An online poll was used to determine the state’s favorite design. The US Treasury Department provided final approval.\n\nA special release ceremony took place on November 10, 2008 at Bishop Square in downtown Honolulu, Hawaii. The ceremony featured a children’s hula performance and Hawaiian music. Attendees were allowed to exchange bills for $10 rolls of Hawaii Quarters.",

The second of nine children, he worked on his father's farm as a boy and became an indentured apprentice to a cloth maker as a teenager.   After studying with a county judge, he began to practice law in 1823.   In 1828 Fillmore entered politics, serving as a New York state assemblyman and later in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he chaired the powerful Committee on Ways and Means.   While comptroller of New York, he was elected to serve as President Zachary Taylor's vice president in 1848 as a Whig.   Upon Taylor's death in July 1850, Fillmore became President.\n\nWhile Fillmore was in office, Congress passed the Compromise of 1850, a package of stop-gap measures which effectively postponed the Civil War for a decade.   He also ordered Commodore Matthew C. Perry to lead a naval expedition in 1852 to convince Japan's shogunate government to open relations with the U.S.   This paved the way for the 1854 Treaty of Kanagawa, the first between the two countries, thus ending Japanese isolationism.\n\nAfter two unsuccessful bids for election to the presidency in his own right, he retired to Buffalo, N.Y.   In 1862 former President Fillmore was named the first chancellor of the University of Buffalo, now the State University of New York at Buffalo.   He died in Buffalo on March 8, 1874.",

  "subject": "13th President, 1850 - 1853\n\nMillard Fillmore was born in a log cabin on January 7, 1800, in Locke (now Summerhill), N.Y.   The second of nine children, he worked on his father's farm as a boy and became an indentured apprentice to a cloth maker as a teenager.   After studying with a county judge, he began to practice law in 1823.   In 1828 Fillmore entered politics, serving as a New York state assemblyman and later in the U.S. House of Representatives, where he chaired the powerful Committee on Ways and Means.   While comptroller of New York, he was elected to serve as President Zachary Taylor's vice president in 1848 as a Whig.   Upon Taylor's death in July 1850, Fillmore became President.\n\nWhile Fillmore was in office, Congress passed the Compromise of 1850, a package of stop-gap measures which effectively postponed the Civil War for a decade.   He also ordered Commodore Matthew C. Perry to lead a naval expedition in 1852 to convince Japan's shogunate government to open relations with the U.S.   This paved the way for the 1854 Treaty of Kanagawa, the first between the two countries, thus ending Japanese isolationism.\n\nAfter two unsuccessful bids for election to the presidency in his own right, he retired to Buffalo, N.Y.   In 1862 former President Fillmore was named the first chancellor of the University of Buffalo, now the State University of New York at Buffalo.   He died in Buffalo on March 8, 1874.",

He was apprenticed to a tailor as a boy and later opened a tailor shop in Greeneville, Tenn., married Eliza McCardle and participated in debates at the local academy.   Entering politics, he became an adept stump speaker, championing the common man and vilifying the plantation aristocracy.  As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate in the 1840s and 1850s, he advocated a homestead bill to provide a free farm for poor men.  In 1864, the Republican Party nominated Johnson, a Democrat, for vice president.\n\nAfter President Abraham Lincoln's death, President Johnson proceeded with a moderate approach to reconstruct the southern states.  Radical Republicans in Congress, however, had their own plans and again placed southern states under military rule.  They passed laws placing restrictions upon the President.  When Johnson allegedly violated the Tenure of Office Act by dismissing Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, the House of Representatives voted 11 articles of impeachment against him.

He was apprenticed to a tailor as a boy and later opened a tailor shop in Greeneville, Tenn., married Eliza McCardle and participated in debates at the local academy.   Entering politics, he became an adept stump speaker, championing the common man and vilifying the plantation aristocracy.  As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate in the 1840s and 1850s, he advocated a homestead bill to provide a free farm for poor men.  In 1864, the Republican Party nominated Johnson, a Democrat, for vice president.\n\nAfter President Abraham Lincoln's death, President Johnson proceeded with a moderate approach to reconstruct the southern states.  Radical Republicans in Congress, however, had their own plans and again placed southern states under military rule.  They passed laws placing restrictions upon the President.  When Johnson allegedly violated the Tenure of Office Act by dismissing Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, the House of Representatives voted 11 articles of impeachment against him.

  "subject": "The 2011 Vicksburg National Military Park Quarter represented the fourth release of the America the Beautiful Quarters series for 2011 and the ninth release for the series overall. The site was selected to represent the state of Mississippi.\n\nThe Vicksburg Quarter features a surprising depiction of the U.S.S. Cairo on the Yazoo River. Rather than depicting a present day scene from the park or one of the many monuments present, the striking image of the ironclad gunboat is shown as it would have been seen when it was used by the Union Navy during the Civil War. The image was designed by Thomas Cleveland and sculpted by Joseph Menna.\n\nOn the coin’s obverse is the the portrait of George Washington that used for all issues of the series. It was originally designed for the 1932 Washington Quarter, and used either in original or modified format for all circulating quarter dollars issued since.\n\nThe circulation release date for the Vicksburg National Military Park Quarter was August 29, 2011. The coins were distributed to the channels of circulation by Federal Reserve Banks and available within various numismatic products offered by the United States Mint. Finally, a five ounce silver bullion version was distributed through the US Mint’s network of authorized purchasers.\n\nThe circulation mintage for the Vicksburg Quarter reached a total of 64,200,000. This was broken down between 30,800,000 coins struck at Philadelphia and 33,400,000 coins struck at Denver.",

In the prior State Quarters Program, the state of Alaska had been featured second to last. It comes early in the sequence for the new program since releases are determined by the date an area came under federal protection.\n\nThe reverse design for the coin features the image of a Dall sheep with Mount McKinley towering in the background. Similar compositions have been used for other sites which comprise vast areas including mountain ranges. The inscriptions appearing around the outer edge of the coin include “Denali”, “Alaska”, “2012″, and “E Pluribus Unum”. The reverse was designed by Susan Gamble and sculpted by Jim Licaretz.\n\nOn the obverse of the coin is the 1932 portrait of George Washington with the inscriptions “United States of America”, “Liberty”, “In God We Trust”, and the denomination “Quarter Dollar”. The portrait was restored from the original John Flanagan design.\n\nA tentative release date for the Denali National Park Quarter has been set for November 5, 2012. This is the date when the quarters will be released into general circulation. Typically, the United States Mint and National Park Service host a launch ceremony to mark the occasion.",
